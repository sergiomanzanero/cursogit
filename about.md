## Who I am

{: .container}
My name is Alfonso. If you are reading this page my guess is that you want to know a little bit more
about me. So, let's start with who I am.

{: .container}
In 2011, Morpheo showed me the road that I should start walking and [I took the red pill](https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/Redpill) 
(I really like this metaphor from The Matrix, because it describes rather well what
happened to me at that point in my life).
I realized I was lost and I decided to take the opportunity that Morpheo gave me to start a journey that I wasn't sure 
where it would take me. I started walking hoping to find a destination. It took me a few more years to find out that 
there was no destination, just walking, running or crawling down the road is all that matters. It's a road with 
ups and downs, fear, pain, joy, tears... but at the end of the day a road worth walking.

Today, I wake up every day doing my best to walk down that road a little more. This is who I am.

## What I do for a living

{: .container}
I've been a full-stack web developer for about 15 years. In my first years I was using PHP. I switched to Ruby on Rails in
2013 and have been using that technology since then.

{: .container}
Nowadays, I'm working at the DevOps team of Platform161 with a group of amazing people.

{: .container}
I'm also an IT trainer/teacher. I've developed a [git course](https://www.cursodegit.com) that is helping a lot of 
teams to stop struggling with git and start using it like pros!!

## Other things about me

{: .container}
I like to **host rescued animals**. I live with my girlfriend, one dog rescued in 2010, a cat we found abandoned in 
the street in October 2018 (she weighted 120 gr. back then) and another 5 months old rescued cat that join our family 
in August 2020.
